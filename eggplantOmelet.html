			<h3>INSTRUCTIONS: </h3>
			<p>Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Add salt, ground black pepper, and garlic powder. Continue to beat until all ingredients are well blended. Set aside.
                Use a fork to create tiny holes all over the eggplant. Cook the eggplant by either baking it in the oven at 400F for 20 to 25 minutes, or exposing it in fire over a stove top until the skin gets burnt and turns black.
                Let the eggplant cool down. Peel the skin then cut the stalk off. Arrange the eggplant flat in a plate. Gently mash using a fork.
                Transfer the mashed eggplant to the bowl with beaten egg. Beat until the eggplant is well incorporated with all the ingredients.
                Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a pan. Once the oil gets hot, pour the mixture into the pan. Continue to cook in low to medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes.
                Flip the eggplant omellette using a plate. Do this by lifting the pan and tilt it towards the plate until the content slides into the plate (you can also use a spatula). Make sure that the cooked part is facing down. Now, hold the plate with one hand and the pan with the other. Cover the plate with pan and then quickly flip it over in a way that the top part of the omellete (which is still uncooked) touches the base of the pan. Continue to cook for 3 minutes.
                Transfer to a serving plate. Serve with your favorite condiment.
